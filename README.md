# InventoryTotem

Triggers your Totem of Undying even if you're not holding the it.

The Totem will not trigger if you're in Creative mode and if you fell into the void, just like vanilla Minecraft.

## Background

I was browsing /r/admincraft and /u/ElwakkaMC [asked about making this plugin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/fras2y/im_making_free_plugins_day_2_3292020/flvhj03?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) So I thought why not make this happen as it's a good idea for my personal server.
